def predict(image):
    """
    Function to perform prediction using the loaded model.
    The image passed to this function is first preprocessed 
    to match the input requirements of the model. 

    If your model expects a certain size, color scale, or 
    normalized data, you would apply those transformations here.

    For example, if you were using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 
    with Keras, it might look like:

    from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image as img_prep
    image = img_prep.img_to_array(image)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    image = image / 255.0
    prediction = model.predict(image)

    The result of model.predict will often be an array of probabilities 
    corresponding to the classes the model can predict.
    You might need to apply a threshold or take the argmax to get a 
    binary prediction or the class label respectively.
