Motivation and solution: I absolutely love the slide, pointing directly to your solution
Team slide: add info about yourself (build credibility)
Contents: good!
Product features: classify nodules and identify cancer cells; the team uses a verity of data. Mention on this slide what are the nodule classes you are trying to classify.
SaaS architecture: didn’t have time to read all of it but what the explaination was good!
Baseline model: ResNet50
Baseline model modeling approach:  nice!
Optimistic results, but…: I wouldn’t report the accuracy at all if the data is imbalanced.
Approach towards final model: segmentation to extract lung volume first. Can you add some image examples on this slide?
Semantic Segmentation: Unet (encoder for downsampling, decoder for upsampling). Can you show evaluation results from this step?
Advanced baseline: 3D CNN
Advanced baseline risk mitigation: I wouldn’t spend time talking about the weighting approach
UI pipeline and our mission: nice, love the slide!


In addition: I added some comments directly to your slides (check GDrive doc). I also checked your GitHub repo (love the readme.md file that explains the code organization)
